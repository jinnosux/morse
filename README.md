### Simple python morse translator

##### Encoder uses speech_recognition library (https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/) for microphone Speech-to-Text, and than translates text into morse code. it uses pygame library to play sounds for each letter in morse.

##### Decoder still uses users input to revert back to text (I'm working on way to manipulate and use audio/microphone to recognize morse code)
