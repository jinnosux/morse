### Simple python morse translator

##### Encoder uses speech_recognition library (https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/) for microphone Speech-to-Text, and than translates text into morse code.

##### Decoder still uses user input to revert back to text (I'm working on way to manipulate and use audio/microphone to recognize morse code)
